# Intelinux
an open source weatherscan like single-purpose Linux distribution designed for the Raspberry Pi using no propietary assets like fonts/graphics/music/narrations, and only free/open source/public domain assets. It will have the following design goals:

the higher up on the list the more the priority
 we also need a forum, a website, and a dedicated discord server, although focus on the other tasks first
use a free weather API (either the national weather service API or OpenWeatherMap)
 make it look, feel, and sound somewhat like The Weather Channel/Weatherscan
 have a way to update the data without having to restart the web server
 someday add an airport conditions product, a health product, and golf, garden, ski, beach, travel, traffic and international products, and other products TWC or Weatherscan or possibly Local Now had/have.
someday turn this into a dedicated, single purpose Linux distribution that you could flash on an SD card and run on a beRaspberry Pi, with the ability to add local weather sensors to the Raspberry PI so you could view stuff like the temperature outside your house. in addition, the local  weather sensor data would have higher priority than the data from the API's so if there was both data from the weather API  AND the outdoor local temperature sensor it would use the outdoor thermometer instead of the data from the API.
we also need a severe weather mode where it will show just the radar and the warning crawl and other basic info
we also need a interactive configuration menu so you dont have to be that technical to configure it, and you don't have to fiddle with javascript or other code
we also need a method of keeping the distribution automatically up to date without reinstalling, and with minimal downtime.
we also need weather safety tips
we also need weather data for around the world, not just the USA
add m3u and XMLTV playlists
add an almanac product
add headless output to FFMPEG
built in EAS encoder/decoder with simulated character generator with preset graphics packages, for example Trilithic EASyPLUS
I think the distribution should be Gentoo Linux Based

only use TWC API as a last resort if there are no other options. https://www.ibm.com/weather
