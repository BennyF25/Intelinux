# Intelinux
An completely open-source Intellistar like software to gather data from the NWS API, turn it into text and graphics, and then render it. perhaps use something like OBS for video capturing/output, a fork of an open-source rendering engine, and then a way to grab data from the NWS API and send it into the rendering engine.

## Developments
### To Do
* Free Weather API implementation [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) or [NOAA Api](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
* TWC/WeatherScan themed
* Update data on a timely schedule (like 30m to a few hours)
* More products like Airport Conditions, Health, Golf, Garden, Ski, Beach, Travel, Traffic, and International (+ some more possibly?)
* Severe Weather Mode
* Easy to use Settings interface
* Seamless updates (reboot at night if necesarry)
* Media direct output when device off or updating (like an [IntelliSTAR's Thunderstorm card](would need add on card for video input and output(https://youtu.be/kLLdT2xFcWM?t=351))
* Weather Saftey Tips
* International weather data
* M3U and XMLTV support
* Almanac Product
* Headless output to FFMPEG
* Built in EAS encoder/decoder with simulated character generator with EAS screen presets, like a [Trilithic EASyPLUS](https://emergencyalertsystem.fandom.com/wiki/Trilithic_EASyPLUS/EASyCAST/EASyIPTV_Screen) preset
* [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) based
* Overlay text onto video like normal IntelliSTARs

* ### After Completion
* Fourm 
* Website 
* Discord Server
